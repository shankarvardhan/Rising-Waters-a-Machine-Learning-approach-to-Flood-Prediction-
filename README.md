# Rising-Waters-a-Machine-Learning-approach-to-Flood-Prediction-
Rising Waters: A deep learning-powered flood prediction system using LSTM networks to provide real-time, hyper-local early warnings by integrating meteorological and hydrological data.
Project OverviewRising Waters is an advanced predictive analytics platform designed to mitigate the devastating impacts of flooding. By leveraging Deep Learning (LSTM), the system processes historical hydrological patterns and real-time meteorological data to provide hyper-local, early-warning flood forecasts.Unlike traditional static models, this solution adapts to changing climate patterns, offering city officials and emergency responders a "Golden Hour" advantage for evacuations and resource deployment.✨ Key FeaturesPredictive Hydrographs: Visualizes predicted water levels vs. critical flood stages.Temporal Deep Learning: Uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to account for soil saturation and rainfall "lag" effects.Real-time API Integration: Pulls live data from USGS (River Gauges) and OpenWeather (Precipitation).Interactive Dashboard: A Flask-based web interface featuring GIS maps for inundation zone visualization.Early Warning Alerts: Automated triggers when predicted water levels exceed safety thresholds.🏗️ Technical ArchitectureThe system follows a robust 3-tier architecture:Data Layer: Ingests CSV/API data from NOAA, USGS, and satellite moisture sensors.Logic Layer: A Python backend running a trained LSTM model for time-series forecasting.Presentation Layer: A responsive Flask dashboard utilizing Leaflet.js for spatial mapping.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: PythonML Frameworks: TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM), Scikit-learnData Handling: Pandas, NumPy, GeoPandasWeb Framework: FlaskVisualization: Matplotlib, Plotly, Leaflet.js (GIS)Deployment: Docker, AWS/GCP📊 Model PerformanceOur model was trained on 10+ years of historical river basin data:Training $R^2$ Score: 0.97Validation $R^2$ Score: 0.94Lead Time: Provides accurate forecasts up to 24 hours in advance.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.9 or higherAPI Keys for OpenWeather and USGS (optional for live mode)InstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/rising-waters.git
